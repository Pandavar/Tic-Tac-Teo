Tic-Tac-Toe Game
A simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python and Tkinter.

How to Play
The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Two players take turns marking their respective symbol ('X' or 'O') in an empty cell. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game is declared a tie.

Getting Started
To play the game, run the provided Python script tic_tac_toe.py. The graphical user interface will appear, allowing you to make moves by clicking on the corresponding buttons.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. This game uses the Tkinter library, which is typically included with standard Python installations.

Game Rules
Players take turns making moves by clicking on the empty cells.
The game ends when one player achieves three symbols in a row or when all cells are filled.
If a player wins, a pop-up message will declare the winner.
If the game ends in a tie, a pop-up message will announce the tie.
